## About WeGro

WeGro is a universal operating system that utilizes blockchain technology to enhance interoperability, data security, and the power of anonymous personal data.

By providing a semantic parallel inference SDK/API, WeGro enables the true value of blockchain to be unlocked, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries for data validation, storage, and optimization for businesses.
With improved data integrity, reduced transaction costs, decentralization, and security, WeGro offers a data- centered protocol supported by blockchain technology and quantum immune security which coordinates constituent data (patients, consumers, stakeholders, businesses, and trust organizations) via a "universal operating system" (uOS) L2 blockchain. This alleviates unnecessary and duplicative services while lowering costs, improving efficiencies, and exceeding HIPAA/GDPR rules and standards.

WeGro is changing the way stakeholders in related supply chain, health and wellness, energy, education, construction, information security, and Government manage electronic anonymous data and interact with customers, stakeholders, and partners.

## Problem/Solution

1. Due to a lack of knowledge, many people are unable to confidently access or control their data (social media, consumer, medical, financial, et cetera). With our mission to provide data sovereignty to all, WeGro Coin users are able to benefit from unique Tokenomics that have a direct impact on the long-term future data ownership and sovereignty.

2. In today's world, patient, consumer, and business data is often considered a product. Individuals may not have full ownership of their data if they use loyalty programs, social media, e-commerce, retail, and other platforms (or corporate interests) that sell their data. WeGro offers a safe way for everyone to engage and optimize, while democratizing and monetizing anonymous data assets. WeGro aims to empower individuals and businesses by putting the power of their data back into their own hands. This will allow compensation for licensing the portions of their originated data that they choose to share with data requesters.

## Tokenomics

Traditionally, rewards in the form of high-yielding APY, farming via staking, or adding to a liquidity pool have enticed users to buy a particular asset. However, this incentive-driven mindset can be risky as the valuation bubble may burst, leaving holders with a deflated balance. WeGro aims to revolutionize this approach by offering a static incentive known
as a reflection. Simply holding WeGro tokens in your wallet is all it takes to receive Smart Chain BNB reflections added to your balance, proportionate to your WeGro token holdings and respective of overall daily and weekly trading volume. This static incentive benefits everyone, not just early holders.

To comply with our AML policies and support the necessary use case of WeGro tokens, businesses settle most of their transactions using WeGro, which is then deposited into PancakeSwap liquidity. As a result, 100% of the profits from transaction data collection licensing are realized in the form of SmartChain BNB and individually distributed to the user. Because rewards are distributed in the form of BNB, there is no downward pressure on the market from holders selling their reflections, or from dev teams, subcontractors, or influencers cashing out large amounts of tokens for payment.
WeGro implements a 2% base manual burn based on daily transaction volume to stabilize the demand curve. The holder does not absorb these fees, but instead, WeGro Coin executes them as manual burns from the total supply.

## Reflections

Reflections provide a solution to several issues as it incentivizes token owners to hold onto their tokens and receive increasing rewards as trading volume grows. The BNB liquidity injected is returned directly to token owners in proportion to their ownership share.

Unlike farming, which benefits early investors
disproportionately, reflections offer the owner the ability to continually generate more Smart Chain BNB over time by simply holding onto their tokens and checking their wallet balance.

## Accelerated Liquidity Pool Yields

> #### WeGro employs a unique 3-part protocol for accelerated liquidity generation, setting it apart from other tokens.
> 
> #### 8% All transactions made by buyers and sellers using the contract are charged an 8% fee per protocol rules.
> #### 5% BNB SmartChain rewards are distributed to WeGro token holders
> #### 2% A portion of the transaction fee, specifically 2%, is allocated to a wallet controlled by WeGro for the purpose of ecosystem expansion.
> #### 1%  portion of the transaction fee is automatically added to the PancakeSwap Liquidity.

WeGro's ecosystem is designed to benefit the community by allowing businesses to use WeGro for their transactions. This enables the aggregation of valuable data for the future WeGro Blockchain Operating System and helps maintain compliance with AML policies. Every transaction contributes to the daily trading volume, which in turn increases the rewards for the token holders and the value of their anonymous data being collected.

WeGro collects personalized and anonymized data on an opt-in basis during every transaction, which is HIPAA and GDPR compliant, and anonymous. These data assets are then licensed, and revenues from their collection are distributed back to the token holders in a cryptocurrency that best suits the current market conditions. For now, SmartChain BNB is used for distribution, but as part of the Phase II development, WeGro plans to release its wallet/vault, data solutions, and neo card, which are expected to be launched in Q3 2023.

WeGro's transaction fees are designed to prevent arbitrage and secure the volume of the token as a reward for its holders, creating stability through an increased liquidity pool. The liquidity pool benefits the token's overall liquidity, supporting its price floor in the long term, unlike other reflection tokens' short-term benefits from a reduced supply. The growing liquidity pool provides a solid price floor relative to the market and acts as a cushion for holders, preventing larger dips if large token holders sell their tokens. This prevents price fluctuations and reduces the impact of market volatility on WeGro's price.

## Manual Burns

While burning tokens on a single protocol can be convenient in the early days, it means that the burn cannot be finite or regulated in any manner. To keep the community involved and rewarded, burns can be managed by the team and boosted based on accomplishments. The conditions and volumes of the manual burn can be marketed and tracked.

WeGro aims to implement a burn strategy that is beneficial and rewarding for those who engage for the long term. In addition, the total number of WeGro burned will be featured on our website, allowing for further transparency in identifying the current circulating supply at any given point in time. The base manual burn will be set at 2% of the daily trading volume.

## Team Token Sale Restriction Protocol

WeGro developers and subcontractors involved in bringing the token to the market are required to follow specific restrictions to prevent the sale of Dev tokens from affecting WeGro's value. Anyone receiving WeGro tokens as payment must adhere to the following guidelines:

WeGro Coin LLC will convert WeGro Coin tokens to Binance-Peg USDT and distribute profits to all contracted WeGro employees, subcontractors, or individuals contracted under the same terms per their percentage of overall tokens held by WeGro Coin LLC until their overall amount is satisfied.

The entire group of developers, subcontractors, vendors, or others cannot collectively sell more than 10% of the 24-hour total positive increase of the token on days where the price has increased. Additionally, internal WeGro holders cannot collectively sell more than 1% of the 24-hour total negative decrease on days where the price has decreased.

## Data Solutions

WeGro's investment project focuses on democratizing data through the development of the larger WeGro Data ecosystem, which includes HyperTuringTM and project LynkTM. This ecosystem supports patients, consumers, and businesses by creating a data feedback loop that enables data driven decision making and allows WeGro to function as a Blockchain and Data Service Provider (DSP).

The development of WeGro Data's "universal" blockchain operating system involves a crossover backbone that allows for the verification, storage, and permissive sharing of data in a blackbox schema. This allows companies to benefit from verifying data along the blockchain without requiring direct relationships with each other.

WeGro Data has already secured commitments from multiple partner companies to build their solutions on our blockchain using semantic parallel inference programming. This will allow industry, consumers, and government to take advantage of the security and decentralization of data on the blockchain without the high costs typically associated with building custom blockchain solutions, and/or high gas fees associated with existing high-volume blockchains.

Constituents on the WeGro blockchain, as well as through partnered companies and applications, will have the option to share their data for both utility and/or monetization, being remunerated in WeGro tokens for doing so. All data within the WeGro Data ecosystem is personalized, yet anonymized, and is stored, utilized, and shared in a manner that complies with CCPA, HIPAA, and GDPR regulations using the most advanced and trusted security solutions available for anti-counterfeiting, provenance, Track/Trace, and global supply chain logistics.
